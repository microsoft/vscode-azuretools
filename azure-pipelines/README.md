## Usage

### 1ES pipelines
To use these base pipeline templates:
1. Your project must have an `.nvmrc` file with the appropriate Node.js version at the root of the repository
1. Your `package.json` file must contain the following NPM scripts:
    1. `build`: this should get the code built sufficiently that it is testable. Note, for a VSCode extension, this should include bundling (webpack, esbuild).
    1. `package`: this should do whatever packaging is needed of the built code--e.g. into a .vsix, .tgz, etc. The resulting package files will be published as build artifacts. This will always run after the `build` script, so it is not necessary to have a prepack script.
    1. `test`: this should run the tests. This will always run after the `build` script, so it is not necessary to have a pretest script.
1. Create a `.azure-pipelines` folder at the root of the repository
1. Create a `1esmain.yml` file in `.azure-pipelines` with the following contents:

```yaml
# Trigger the build whenever `main` or `rel/*` is updated
trigger:
  - main
  - rel/*

# Disable PR trigger
pr: none

# Scheduled nightly build of `main`
schedules:
  - cron: "0 0 * * *"
    displayName: Nightly scheduled build
    always: false # Don't rebuild if there haven't been changes
    branches:
      include:
        - main

# `resources` specifies the location of templates to pick up, use it to get AzExt templates
resources:
  repositories:
    - repository: azExtTemplates
      type: github
      name: microsoft/vscode-azuretools
      ref: main
      endpoint: GitHub-AzureTools # The service connection to use when accessing this repository

# Use those templates
extends:
  template: azure-pipelines/1esmain.yml@azExtTemplates
```

### (DEPRECATED) Primary pipelines

To use these base pipeline templates:
1. Your project must have an `.nvmrc` file with the appropriate Node.js version at the root of the repository
1. Your `package.json` file must contain the following NPM scripts:
    1. `build`: this should get the code built sufficiently that it is testable. Note, for a VSCode extension, this should include bundling (webpack, esbuild).
    1. `package`: this should do whatever packaging is needed of the built code--e.g. into a .vsix, .tgz, etc. The resulting package files will be published as build artifacts. This will always run after the `build` script, so it is not necessary to have a prepack script.
    1. `test`: this should run the tests. This will always run after the `build` script, so it is not necessary to have a pretest script.
1. Create a `.azure-pipelines` folder at the root of the repository
1. Copy `compliance/CredScanSuppressions.json`, and `compliance/PoliCheckExclusions.xml` into `.azure-pipelines/compliance`, structured as such:
```
<RepositoryRoot>
    .azure-pipelines
        compliance
            CredScanSuppressions.json
            PoliCheckExclusions.xml
```
5. Create a `main.yml` file in `.azure-pipelines` with the following contents:

```yaml
# Trigger the build whenever `main` or `rel/*` is updated
trigger:
  - main
  - rel/*

# Disable PR trigger
pr: none

# Scheduled nightly build
schedules:
  - cron: "0 0 * * *"
    displayName: Nightly scheduled build
    always: false # Don't rebuild if there haven't been changes
    branches:
      include:
        - main

# Grab the base templates from https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-azuretools/tree/main/azure-pipelines
resources:
  repositories:
    - repository: templates
      type: github
      name: microsoft/vscode-azuretools
      ref: main
      endpoint: GitHub

# Use those templates
extends:
  template: azure-pipelines/jobs.yml@templates
```

### (DEPRECATED) Releasing to NPM

1. Releasing to NPM requires only a simple YAML pipeline file, for example this `release-npm.yml` file in `.azure-pipelines`:

```yaml
trigger: none # Disable the branch trigger
pr: none # Disable PR trigger

# Choose a package to publish at the time of job creation
parameters:
  - name: PackageToPublish
    displayName: Package to Publish
    type: string
    values:
      - microsoft-vscode-container-client
      - microsoft-vscode-docker-registries
      - your-packages-here

# Grab the base templates from https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-azuretools/tree/main/azure-pipelines
resources:
  repositories:
    - repository: templates
      type: github
      name: microsoft/vscode-azuretools
      ref: main
      endpoint: GitHub

# Use those base templates
extends:
  template: azure-pipelines/release-npm.yml@templates
  parameters:
    PackageToPublish: ${{ parameters.PackageToPublish }}
    PipelineDefinition: 33

```
2. Running the pipeline will release the package to NPM and create a draft GitHub release. Add change notes to the draft release and publish when complete.
