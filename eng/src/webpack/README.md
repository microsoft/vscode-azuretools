# Webpack Config for Azure Visual Studio Code Extensions

TODO

[Back to Root](../../README.md)

Looking at what we need from the original.

- VSCode extern
- Copy plugin for resources SVGs. Something to fix executable bit?
- Entrypoint fixes
- Source map stuff?
- Terser settings
- ESBuild loader settings
- Ignore some warnings

Looking at what we can probably skip for now.

- Webworker everything, replacements, polyfills etc.
